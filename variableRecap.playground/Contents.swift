// create a variable called age and assign it to your current age
var age = 45


// create a constant called birth year and assign it to the year you were born  (remember to use camel case)
let birthYear = 1972


// write a comment below and explain why age is a variable and birth year is a constant
// var for age because age changes and birth year is a constant because it doesn't change


// add 1 to your age variable and assign it to a variable called birthday
age += 1

print(age)

// you have $34 and milk costs $4 a gallon. You need to buy as much milk as you can. Create 2 constants and use the modulus operator find out how much money you'll have left after buying all the milk that you can. Assign the value to a constant called moneyLeftOver and print moneyLeftOver to the console.
let moneyHave = 34
let costOfMilk = 4
let moneyLeftover = moneyHave % costOfMilk
print(moneyLeftover)
